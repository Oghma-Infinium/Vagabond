# FAQ

## Q: How do I open the OAR menu? How do I open the IED menu?
> A: These menus have been disabled purposefully. Enabling them and messing with these menus is not officially supported. 

## Q: How do I wait?

> A: Open the tween menu (press tab) first.

## Q: Can I play the list in first person?

> A: The combat is meant for 3rd person only and I won't support or solve first-person specific issues with combat. You can use first person for casually exploring or picking up items though.

## Q: Why can't I attack with my left hand weapon?

> A: MCO doesn't support left hand attacks, but if you have a melee weapon in both hands, you will get a dual wield moveset that alternates between both hands by just pressing right hand attack.

## Q: Any video showcase of the list?

> A: [Biggie Boss' Youtube channel has some content](https://www.youtube.com/@biggie_boss/streams). Searching for [`Vagabond Skyrim Modlist`](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vagabond+skyrim+modlist) in Youtube will also give you many results.

## Q: A mod in the list doesn't do what it says on the mod page. Is it broken?

> A: If the mod is under the `Assets and Resources` separator in MO2's left pane, then **do not** assume anything the mod page says about the mod is true for the list. If the mod is not under `Assets and Resources`, then report a bug in `#ðŸ§ â”‚vagabond-support` channel within the [Waking Dreams](https://discord.gg/wakingdreams) server.

## Q: My character's face suddenly became much darker, causing a neck seam. What do I do?

> A: This is a vanilla bug that can be fixed by entering and exiting Racemenu. To enter Racemenu, either use the vanity mirror in your inventory (recommended and safer) or open console and type in: `showracemenu`, then exit Racemenu immediately.


# Known Issues

## Tolfdir won't got to Saarthal!

> A: Just click him on console, walk to Saarthal, and type `prid` in console.

## My Solstheim paper map is purple! 

> A: I forgot to install the map textures. Instructions for a fix is within the pins of the `#ðŸ§ â”‚vagabond-support` channel in the [Waking Dreams](https://discord.gg/wakingdreams) server. This will be fixed in the next update.

## I'm freezing during the winter in Whiterun and Falkreath areas! 

> A: No known fix, currently investigating.

## NPCs line up at underforge entrance in Whiterun and quest markers in Whiterun point towards that door!

> A: No known fix, currently investigating.
