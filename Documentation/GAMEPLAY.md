## Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [readme](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running. Be sure to check out the [configuration](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md) page to learn more about the optional tweaks and addons and MCM options.

## Basics

This section will cover the absolute basics of the list. I suggest reading, or skimming all of the linked mod pages in this section if you are unfamiliar with the preceding mods.

Before reading this section, I suggest looking over the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/vagabond) and [keybinds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond/blob/main/images/keyboard-layout_Vagabond.jpg) or [gamepad binds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond/blob/main/images/controlmap3.png).

## Core Mods

- Perk overhaul for the list is [Vokriinator Black](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26702) which combines perks from [Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137), [Vokrii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26176), [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191), [SPERG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14180) and [Path of Sorcery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6660)
- [Mannaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87219) and [Freyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88043) overhaul races and standing stones. Each standing stone has unique effect for every race, so make sure to read the modpages for these!
- [Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928) and [Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) overhaul vampires and werewolves.
- [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) introduces a religion mechanic.
- [MCO - Modern Combat Overhaul](https://modding-guild.com/mod/attack-mcodxp/) is the core mod for melee combat. It overhauls melee attacks to use attack commitment and combo chaining, similar to other modern action games like Elden Ring and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.
- [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) is the core content mod of the list. It adds a museum in Solitude where you can display most of the items from Vanilla game as well as many mod-added items. The museum also involves its own questline.

### Leveling and Progression

Vagabond uses [Static Skill Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30410) for leveling skills. I have configured it with my custom settings:
- Gain skill points equal to 10 + 1 * level for each level up, which caps at 50 points at level 40.
- You can only store maximum of 50 per level, therefore **after level 40 you must spend all your skills points at level up or you will waste some points.**
- Skill costs are as follows:
  - 0 to 25: 1
  - 26 to 50: 2
  - 51 to 75: 3
  - 76 to 100: 4
  - **Note:** current version by mistake has last two tiers reversed, feel free to correct this in Static Skill Leveling MCM. Will be fixed in update 1.1.4.

erks can be obtained by following ways:
- One perk point from level up.
- From doing radiant quests, explained in [Radiant Quest Point system](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67956) modpage.
- From some major quests listed in [Quests Award Perk Points](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33081) modpage.
- By converting three dragon souls with Oghma Infinium.
- From some boss kills with [Perk Point Awards Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40461).
  - Note: Dragon kills don't give perk points due to soul conversion mechanic. Also no boss gives three points, only one.
