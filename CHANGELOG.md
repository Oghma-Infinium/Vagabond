 - No Disarm

### Removed

 - Mihail diversified chickens
   - I had two mods in the list doing essentially the same thing.

## 0.3.0

### Info

**This update is not save safe.**

Fixed some stuff

 - Refer to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/khix4egd/vagabond-bug-reports) to track which are fixed and which still persist.
 - Except update 0.3.1 to come fairly soon. It will be save-safe with 0.3 so feel free to start playing now.
 - Most creatuers are now KYE2 patched thanks to ChromaticRed
 - UI changed to almost fully NordicUI
 - Rework of the block tree, including Sekiro-style posture break and deathblow.
 - Lots of optimizations to combat behaviors to make movement, blocking and attacks feel smoother.
 - Scythes and two-handed katanas now have unique Ash of War.
 - Overhauled Ash of War and moveset for one hand-placed unique weapon.
 - Lots of combat rebalancing:
   - Enemies now lose 25% less stamina from light attacks than before.
   - Fine tuned the amount of stamina restored to player on light attacks per weapon type.
   - Player now takes 25% more damage from blocked power attacks unless its successfully deflected with timed block. (calculated after block mitigation)
   - Enemies now take 75% less poise damage from light attack when power attacking. This to make it harder to negate enemy power attacks simply by staggering them with a fast light attack.
   - Timed block no longer reflects projectiles back to sender, however parry will do that instead.
   - Further reduced the base magicka recovery. This makes hardly any difference once you get regeneration bonuses from other sources like robes.
   - Twinblades and quarterstaves now deal 50% less poise damage due to them double-hitting on most attacks. Damage output remains unchanged.
 - I added my character as a preset. At the moment the only racemenu preset in the list.
   - If some users want their presets included in the list let me know. You can also upload it to Nexus and I'll include it.
