<Details>

      - This is more "3D" than the last one. I think this matched fairly well with existing terrain LOD so I didn't rerun xlodgen.

</Details>

## 0.1.8

### Info

Fixed some stuff

 - Refer to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/khix4egd/vagabond-bug-reports) to track which are fixed and which still persist.
 - Fixed bunch of blackfaces caused by a mistake in last update. Some blackfaces still persist, most notably Henry from LoTD and Oliver (priestess' guard in Beyond Reach), I wasn't able to solve these even with CK facegen which is bizarre.
 - Fixed some College of Winterhold NPCs being nudist due to an issue with SPID outfits I added last patch... at least I wasn't able to find any more nudists.
 - Undiscovered location markers are again visible on the compass.
 - Added brigther Lux interior templates.

 - Hummingbirds - Optimized Textures

 - Lennys Bench Replacer
